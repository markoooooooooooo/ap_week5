# a function allows us to bundle code ito reusable blocks, making it easier to manage and understand.
# By defining functions, we avoid code duplication and enhance readability.

# define function
def problem1():
     # i put pass to avoid syntax error
    magic = "abracadabra"
    print(magic[5])
    print(magic[-2])
    print(magic.index("c"))

# Problem Set 1: Indexing and Slicing Strings
# Basic Indexing:
# Given the string magic = 'abracadabra',
# a. Retrieve the 5th character.
# b. Retrieve the second to last character.
# c. Find the first occurrence of the letter 'c'.
